朋友还是敌人，4字符为朋友

Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a
list with only your friends name in it.
If a name has 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has
to be a friend of yours!
Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"]
Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]
=end

# My Solution
def friend(friends)
  friends.select { |name| name.length == 4 }
end
